# Forage - AIG Shields Up: Cybersecurity Job Simulation

## Introduction 
The purpose of this repo is to build a Python script to recover passwords from an encrypted ZIP (for authorized / test files only). This activity is part of the AIG Cyber virtual experience program on Forage.

You're provided with the following resources: 

* A password wordlist (RockYou): a well-known list of thousands of commonly used passwords that attackers often try.
* A password-protected ZIP file: your job is to run a brute-force attempt against this ZIP using the wordlist to find the correct plain-text password.
* The solution to the challenge. 
* A foundational Python 3+ template that you can use to write your script solution (give it a go first without peeking at the solution!).

## Requirements
* Python 3+

## Get Started
Simply run the following command: 

```python
python3 bruteforce.py
```
